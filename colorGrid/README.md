# Color Grid on hover

This is my solution to the JavaScript & JQuery assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The task was to create a pixelated canvas that allows users to "draw" with their mouse hovering over grid pixels. The more times a grid has been drawn over, the darker its color.

Users can also customise the number of grids per side within the canvas.
