# Pomodoro Timer Project (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

This is my solution to the Pomodoro Timer assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The task was to create a functional Pomodoro Timer with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Pomodoro Timer is a tool for executing the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

The default session durations are 25 minutes work and 5 minutes break, but user can modify these values with the top left menu.
